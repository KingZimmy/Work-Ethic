Create a home page prototype in Adobe XD where TYPE is the main design element.To get your creative juices going complete the previous assignment first - Find Sites that Use type. In that exercise you will explore sites that use type as a design element. You can incorporate images and/or graphics, just subtly - keeping TYPE as the main design element and focus. Only the Homepage is required - desktop AND mobile. You can use your existing client for the prototype project or make up a new client and/or topic.
